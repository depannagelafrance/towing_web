# Base styes
Base styles define the default look for HTML.

These rules will generally be made up of element selectors for HTML elements
such as headings, paragraphs and lists.

By setting a solid baseline before adding any more specific customisations you ensure that as any new
features are added they will be correctly styled without any extra work.

Only basic HTML element can be in this folder (h1, h2, table, form, input, ...)
